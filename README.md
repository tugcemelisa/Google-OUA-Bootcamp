## SPRINT 1  
- In Sprint 1, our goal was to establish the foundation and overall structure of the game. Development phase: Alpha  
- A total backlog of 400 points was targeted.  
- We decided to base the sprint on an 80-point system. Since we are currently building the main structure of the game, we chose to move the tasks outside of core functionality to the second Scrum. We successfully reached the 80-point goal.

# FINAL RESULT
## About the Game  
**Meadow Monarch** is a 3D third-person simulation game created with a low-poly aesthetic and built for single-player experience. The story follows a character who leaves city life behind to build a new life in the countryside. Starting by taking care of villagers’ animals, the player earns money to eventually purchase their own animals, land, and buildings. At night, players must protect their animals from wolf attacks using a torch. The game features time-of-day and environment transitions to enhance the immersive experience.

### Core Features:
- Herd and manage animals  
- Earn money through tasks and trade  
- Defend against night-time predators  
- Expand your farm with new lands and buildings  
- AI-generated animations and sound effects  

The game balances peaceful farming with strategic survival elements. All animations and voice effects were supported using AI tools like DeepMotion, ElevenLabs, and Suno.
